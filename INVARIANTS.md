-Step 3 — Cross-Product Invariants (Threshold)
+# Cross-Product Invariants — Threshold
 
 Purpose of Invariants
 
 Cross-product invariants exist to ensure that every Threshold product, regardless of use-case (focus, rest, sleep, recovery), adheres to the same:
-	•	seriousness of intent
-	•	operational discipline
-	•	respect for the user’s cognitive and physical state
+- seriousness of intent
+- operational discipline
+- respect for the user’s cognitive and physical state
 
 They override product-specific creativity.

 A Threshold product is designed to enable a state transition, not to provide indulgence, entertainment, or pleasure-first consumption.
 
 Implications:
-	•	Taste is allowed to be acceptable, clean, restrained — never optimized for craving.
-	•	No product may rely on sweetness, flavor intensity, or novelty to drive repeat use.
-	•	If a formulation change increases hedonic pull at the cost of discipline, it is invalid.

 Threshold products must reduce internal noise, not add to it.
 
 Implications:
-	•	No formulation may rely on sharp stimulatory spikes (physiological or psychological).
-	•	Any active ingredient must support smooth, gradual, or grounding effects.
-	•	Marketing, naming, and packaging must never imply urgency, hype, or performance pressure.

 The ritual is not an accessory — it is part of the product.
 
 Implications:
-	•	Every Threshold product must define:
-	•	when it is taken
-	•	why that moment matters
-	•	what behavior it is meant to initiate or conclude
-	•	Consumption without intention is considered misuse, not a design goal.
-	•	Packaging, instructions, and cadence must reinforce deliberateness.

 User feedback informs iteration, but never overrides frozen intent.
 
 Implications:
-	•	Complaints about bitterness, intensity, or restraint do not automatically justify change.

-	•	The operator may choose to lose customers rather than dilute the system.
