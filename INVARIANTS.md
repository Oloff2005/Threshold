# Cross-Product Invariants — Threshold

## Purpose of Invariants

Cross-product invariants exist to ensure that every Threshold product, regardless of use-case (focus, rest, sleep, recovery), adheres to the same:

- seriousness of intent  
- operational discipline  
- respect for the user’s cognitive and physical state  

They override product-specific creativity.

## Invariant 1 — Threshold Products Are Tools, Not Treats

A Threshold product is designed to enable a state transition, not to provide indulgence, entertainment, or pleasure-first consumption.

**Implications:**
- Taste is allowed to be acceptable, clean, restrained — never optimized for craving.
- No product may rely on sweetness, flavor intensity, or novelty to drive repeat use.
- If a formulation change increases hedonic pull at the cost of discipline, it is invalid.

This invariant applies equally to:
- Pre-Work Deep Calm
- Post-Work Deep Rest
- Any future Threshold product

## Invariant 2 — Calm Is the Primary Signal, Not Stimulation

Threshold products must reduce internal noise, not add to it.

**Implications:**
- No formulation may rely on sharp stimulatory spikes (physiological or psychological).
- Any active ingredient must support smooth, gradual, or grounding effects.
- Marketing, naming, and packaging must never imply urgency, hype, or performance pressure.

If a product “pushes,” it is disqualified.  
Threshold products pull.

## Invariant 3 — Ritual Precedes Chemistry

The ritual is not an accessory — it is part of the product.

**Implications:**
- Every Threshold product must define:
  - when it is taken  
  - why that moment matters  
  - what behavior it is meant to initiate or conclude  
- Consumption without intention is considered misuse, not a design goal.
- Packaging, instructions, and cadence must reinforce deliberateness.

A product that “works even if used mindlessly” violates the Threshold ethos.

## Invariant 4 — Operator Discipline Overrides Market Feedback

User feedback informs iteration, but never overrides frozen intent.

**Implications:**
- Complaints about bitterness, intensity, or restraint do not automatically justify change.
- Market desire for convenience, sweetness, or stimulation is not binding.
- The operator may choose to lose customers rather than dilute the system.

Threshold optimizes for alignment, not mass appeal.

---

## Invariant 5 — Decisions Must Be Explicit, Traceable, and Reversible

No Threshold product may evolve through silent drift.

**Implications:**
- All meaningful decisions must live in the product’s operator-core.
- Frozen decisions may change only through documented revision.
- Experiments must be labeled as such.
- Nothing “just happens.”

If a change cannot be pointed to and explained, it does not exist.

---

## Invariant 6 — Symmetry Across Products Is Structural, Not Cosmetic

Different products may differ in formulation and use-case, but never in seriousness.

**Implications:**
- Every Threshold product must have:
  - a full operator-core  
  - a defined ritual  
  - explicit boundaries  
  - a decision-freeze mechanism  
- No product is allowed to be “lighter,” “simpler,” or “more casual” in governance.

Pre-Work and Post-Work are counterparts, not tiers.

---

## Invariant 7 — Threshold Is Allowed to Be Narrow

A Threshold product is allowed to be:
- misunderstood
- rejected
- too intense
- too minimal
- too disciplined

It is not allowed to be:
- vague
- compromised
- apologetic
- diluted for scale

If clarity reduces adoption, clarity still wins.
