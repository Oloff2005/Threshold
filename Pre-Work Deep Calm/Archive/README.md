# Archive — Historical Record Only

This folder contains **inactive, deprecated, or superseded materials**
related to the Threshold product “Pre-Work Deep Calm”.

Nothing in this folder is considered current, authoritative, or actionable.

Archive exists to preserve **memory**, not to influence decisions.

## What Belongs in Archive

Archive contains:

- Old product formulations
- Superseded specifications
- Rejected or abandoned ideas
- Deprecated design assets
- Previous packaging iterations
- Outdated pilot materials
- Experiments that are no longer active

Files are moved here **only after** a decision has been made elsewhere.

## What Does NOT Belong in Archive

Archive is **not**:

- A working folder
- A backup for active files
- A place for “maybe later” ideas
- A source of reference for current decisions

If something might still influence a decision,
it does **not** belong here.

---

## Authority Rule

Nothing in Archive can:

- Override Operating Core
- Re-open frozen decisions
- Justify changes by precedent
- Be cited as “what we used to think”

Archive has **zero authority**.

---

## When to Use Archive

Use Archive when:

- A decision has been replaced
- A version is no longer valid
- You want to prevent re-litigating an idea
- You want to keep historical context without clutter

Archiving is a sign of clarity, not abandonment.

## Internal Reminder

Progress requires forgetting.

Archive exists so you don’t have to.
