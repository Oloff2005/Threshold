# Design & Branding — Expression, Not Authority

This folder contains the **visual and experiential expression** of the Threshold
product “Pre-Work Deep Calm”.

Design & Branding does **not** define what the product is.
It expresses decisions that have already been made elsewhere.

If there is ever a conflict between design and product reality,
**product reality wins**.

---

## Purpose of This Folder

The purpose of Design & Branding is to:

- Express the product as it truly is
- Support deliberate, tool-like use
- Reduce confusion at first contact
- Reinforce restraint, not excitement

Design here should feel:
- calm
- minimal
- intentional
- functional

---

## Authority Boundary (Critical)

Design & Branding has **no authority** over:

- Product formulation
- Taste, texture, or ingredients
- Functional claims
- Intended use cases
- Target outcomes

All of the above are defined in **Operating Core**.

Design must conform to:
- product constraints
- functional intent
- phase objectives

---

## What Belongs in This Folder

- Packaging designs and dielines
- Logos and wordmarks
- Typography and colour systems
- Visual mockups and renders
- Layout explorations
- Physical artefact design (cards, inserts, wrappers)

These assets should reflect:
- restraint
- seriousness
- clarity of use

---

## What Does NOT Belong in This Folder

Explicitly excluded:

- Product decisions or experiments
- Changes to ingredients or formulation
- New functional claims
- Marketing promises
- Validation data or pilot results
- Growth or conversion experiments

If design suggests something the product does not actually do,
the design must be corrected.

---

## Phase Awareness

Current phase: **Product Lock-In (Pre-Pilot)**

During this phase:
- Design supports understanding and use
- Design does not attempt persuasion
- Design avoids optimisation for appeal or virality

Aesthetic improvement is secondary to **functional clarity**.

---

## Design Test (Use This Before Finalising Anything)

Before accepting any design asset, ask:

1. Does this imply sweetness, stimulation, or indulgence?
2. Does this encourage casual consumption?
3. Does this add unnecessary narrative or promise?

If “yes” to any → revise or reject.

---

## Internal Reminder

Design is not here to make the product attractive.

Design is here to make the product **understandable**,
**usable**, and **honest**.

Restraint is a feature, not a limitation.
