# UGC — Growth After Truth

This folder contains materials related to **user-generated content (UGC)**
for the Threshold product “Pre-Work Deep Calm”.

UGC is a **growth tool**, not a discovery tool.

It is activated **only after** product truth has been established
and validated through a successful pilot.

---

## Authority Boundary (Critical)

UGC has **no authority** over:

- Product formulation
- Functional claims
- Intended use
- Target audience definition
- Narrative direction

All of the above are defined upstream in **Operating Core**
and validated in **Pilot**.

UGC expresses truth — it does not discover it.

---

## Activation Rule (Very Important)

UGC remains inactive until all of the following are true:

- Product spec is frozen
- Pilot outcome = GO
- Core functional claim is locked
- Usage instruction is stable

If these conditions are not met, this folder must remain dormant.

---

## What Belongs in This Folder

Once activated, this folder may contain:

- Creator briefs
- Content guidelines
- Do / don’t lists for creators
- Usage demonstrations
- Narrative constraints
- Asset checklists
- Posting frameworks

UGC should show:
- real use
- restraint
- clarity of purpose

---

## What Does NOT Belong in This Folder

Explicitly excluded:

- Hypothetical content ideas
- Aspirational branding
- Performance claims not validated
- Influencer outreach strategies
- Paid advertising experiments
- Content designed purely for virality

If content requires exaggeration to work, it is rejected.

---

## Phase Awareness

Current phase: **Inactive**

UGC is intentionally deprioritised during:
- Product lock-in
- Pilot preparation
- Pilot execution

Premature UGC creates noise and weakens trust.

---

## Internal Reminder

UGC is not about attention.

UGC is about **demonstration**.

The product must speak for itself.
