# Packaging Constraints — Threshold: Pre-Work Deep Calm

This document defines **explicit constraints** that packaging must not violate.

Constraints exist to prevent:
- narrative drift
- expectation inflation
- misuse
- design-led distortion of product truth

These constraints override aesthetic preference.

---

## Conceptual Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

Packaging must NOT:

- Frame the product as food or a treat
- Suggest indulgence, pleasure, or reward
- Suggest stimulation, energy, or performance enhancement
- Imply relaxation, calm, or mood alteration as a promise
- Encourage emotional attachment or excitement

If packaging suggests “how it will make you feel”, it is rejected.

---

## Language Constraints

Packaging must NOT include:

- Benefit claims (explicit or implied)
- Words such as:
  - focus
  - productivity
  - calm
  - energy
  - performance
  - ritual
  - boost
- Scientific or pseudo-scientific language
- Testimonials or quotes

Packaging language must remain **instructional, not persuasive**.

---

## Visual Constraints

Packaging must NOT:

- Use bright or saturated colours
- Use playful or decorative typography
- Use imagery associated with:
  - food enjoyment
  - lifestyle aspiration
  - luxury consumption
- Include photography of people, faces, or environments

Abstract, minimal design is preferred.

---

## Structural Constraints

Packaging must NOT:

- Encourage frequent opening and closing
- Enable easy overconsumption
- Obscure piece count or intended duration
- Feel collectible or precious

If users hesitate to use it because it feels “too nice”, the packaging has failed.

---

## Brand Constraints

Packaging must NOT:

- Over-explain the brand
- Tell a story
- Introduce secondary narratives
- Position Threshold as a lifestyle identity

Threshold is a tool, not a badge.

---

## Scope Constraints

Packaging must NOT attempt to:

- Educate the user fully
- Replace instruction or practice
- Compensate for missing product validation

Packaging supports use — it does not justify the product.

---

## Change Control

Any proposal that violates these constraints must:

- be explicitly documented
- include a rationale
- be approved in Operating Core

Silent violations are not permitted.

---

## Internal Reminder

Packaging is the **first interface** between user and product.

If packaging misleads, the product is blamed — not the design.

Restraint is not optional.
