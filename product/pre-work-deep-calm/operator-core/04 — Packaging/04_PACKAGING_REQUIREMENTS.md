# Packaging Requirements — Threshold: Pre-Work Deep Calm

This document defines the **functional requirements** for all packaging
associated with the Threshold product “Pre-Work Deep Calm”.

Packaging exists to:
- support correct use
- reduce friction at the moment of use
- avoid misinterpretation
- protect product integrity

Packaging is not a marketing surface.
Packaging is a **functional interface**.

---

## Primary Purpose

Packaging must support the product being used as a **pre-work cue**.

Specifically, it must:
- encourage deliberate, intentional use
- discourage casual or snack-like consumption
- make correct use obvious without explanation
- avoid implying stimulation, indulgence, or pleasure

---

## User Interaction Requirements

Packaging must:

- Be easy to open without distraction
- Encourage a brief pause before consumption
- Make it clear that:
  - the product is used *before* work
  - the product is not consumed continuously
- Avoid encouraging multiple pieces in quick succession

If packaging encourages grazing, it has failed.

---

## Information Hierarchy

Packaging should communicate, in order of importance:

1. Brand name (Threshold)
2. The act of transition / beginning
3. Clear, minimal usage cue

Packaging must **not** attempt to:
- explain benefits
- persuade
- educate extensively

Understanding should come from use, not text.

---

## Text Requirements

- Text must be minimal
- Language must be neutral and instructional
- No claims about outcomes
- No performance promises
- No emotional language

If text can be removed without harming use clarity, remove it.

---

## Visual Requirements

Packaging must feel:

- calm
- restrained
- serious
- tool-like

It must **not** feel:
- indulgent
- playful
- luxurious
- energising
- snack-oriented

Visual noise is considered a functional defect.

---

## Physical Requirements

Packaging must:

- Protect chocolate integrity (temperature, handling)
- Prevent melting and bloom as reasonably as possible
- Be appropriate for daily handling
- Be durable enough for a 12-day cycle

Fragile or precious-feeling packaging is discouraged.

---

## Scale Awareness

Packaging must be:

- feasible at pilot scale
- reproducible without custom artisanal processes
- cost-aware (without cost optimisation at this stage)

Packaging that cannot scale beyond the pilot is unacceptable.

---

## Compliance with Product Spec

Packaging must conform to all constraints defined in:
- `01_PRODUCT_SPEC.md`
- `01_SPEC_FREEZE_CHECKLIST.md`

Packaging may not compensate for product shortcomings.

---

## Acceptance Test

Packaging is acceptable only if:

- A new user can infer correct use without explanation
- The product does not feel like a snack
- The packaging does not create expectations the product does not meet

If any of these fail, the packaging must be revised.
