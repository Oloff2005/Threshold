# Pilot — Controlled Validation

This folder governs the **pilot phase** for the Threshold product
“Pre-Work Deep Calm”.

The pilot exists to test **product truth under controlled conditions**.
It is not a launch, a marketing exercise, or a growth experiment.

The purpose of the pilot is to answer one question only:

> Does this product reliably reduce the friction to starting focused work
> when used as instructed?

---

## Authority Boundary (Critical)

The Pilot folder does **not** define product reality.

- Product truth is defined in **Operating Core**
- The pilot tests that truth under constraint
- Pilot data informs decisions — it does not make them automatically

If pilot feedback conflicts with Operating Core:
- The conflict is analysed
- Decisions are revised only if criteria are explicitly re-opened

---

## What Belongs in This Folder

- Pilot instructions (locked before pilot start)
- Contact scripts and delivery protocols
- Feedback forms and surveys
- Success metrics and thresholds
- Raw pilot data and summaries
- Pilot outcome interpretations

Everything here should be:
- structured
- repeatable
- time-bound

---

## What Does NOT Belong in This Folder

Explicitly excluded:

- Design assets
- Branding or narrative experiments
- Marketing copy
- Growth tactics
- UGC concepts
- Mid-pilot changes or improvisations

No changes are allowed once a pilot has begun.

---

## Pilot Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- Pilot instructions are frozen before first delivery
- No mid-pilot explanation, persuasion, or correction
- No reacting emotionally to feedback
- No adjusting metrics after results are seen
- Data is analysed **before** qualitative comments are read

If these rules are violated, the pilot is invalid.

---

## Current Pilot Status

Status: **Not Active / Pre-Pilot**

Activation requires:
- Product spec frozen
- Packaging finalised
- Pilot criteria locked
- Delivery logistics confirmed

Until then, this folder is **read-only**.

---

## Internal Reminder

The pilot is not about proving success.

It is about earning **clarity**.

A failed pilot is cheaper than a confused launch.
