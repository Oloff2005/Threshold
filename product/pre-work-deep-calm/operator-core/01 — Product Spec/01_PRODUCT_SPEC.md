# Product Specification — Threshold: Pre-Work Deep Calm

This document defines the **current authoritative product specification**
for the Threshold chocolate product “Pre-Work Deep Calm”.

This specification governs:
- what the product *is*
- what the product *cannot become*
- the version that is eligible for pilot testing

If there is any conflict between interpretations, this document prevails.

## SPEC STATUS

Status: UNFROZEN  
Date:  
Formulation version:  

> This specification is considered frozen only when the status above is
> explicitly marked **FROZEN** with a date and rationale.

---

## Product Intent (Non-Negotiable)

Threshold is a **pre-work cue**, not a snack, treat, or stimulant.

Its purpose is to:
- reduce friction to *starting* focused work
- support a calm, deliberate transition
- be usable repeatedly without aversion

Enjoyment is secondary to **appropriateness for use**.

---

## Core Functional Requirements

The product must:

- Be appropriate for repeated daily use
- Create no resistance to reaching for it again
- Avoid harsh, irritating, or aggressive finishes
- Avoid heavy, cloying, or sluggish mouthfeel
- Avoid stimulating or jittery physiological effects
- Feel grounding or neutral after consumption

Failure on any of the above invalidates the spec.

---

## Composition Constraints

### Cacao Content
- High-cacao formulation
- No reduction in cacao percentage for palatability

### Sweeteners
- No added sugar
- No sweeteners of any kind

### Flavouring
- No added flavours
- No masking agents
- No inclusions

### Additives
- No functional additives
- No stimulants
- No nootropics

Chocolate remains the sole functional medium.

---

## Sensory Profile (Target, Not Poetry)

### Bitterness
- High, but clean
- No sharp or aggressive bite
- No bitterness that escalates into discomfort

### Astringency
- Low to moderate
- No drying or puckering that lingers

### Mouthfeel
- Smooth
- Even melt
- No chalkiness
- No waxy or greasy coating

### Finish & Aftertaste
- Clean finish
- Mild lingering cocoa acceptable
- No harsh residue
- No heaviness

---

## Physiological Effect (Observed, Not Claimed)

- Neutral to grounding
- No stimulation
- No crash
- No discomfort

This is observed internally and through pilots,
not marketed as a promise.

---

## Manufacturing Requirements

- Reproducible at pilot scale
- Stable tempering
- No fragile one-off handling required
- Consistent texture and finish

---

## Allowed Adjustments (Pre-Freeze Only)

Before the spec is frozen, the following may be adjusted:

- Roast profile
- Conching time
- Texture refinement
- Bitterness *quality* (not level)
- Mouthfeel improvements

Any adjustment must preserve all non-negotiables.

---

## Explicitly Disallowed Changes

- Adding sweetness for acceptance
- Reducing cacao percentage
- Adding flavours or functional compounds
- Optimising for enjoyment or mass appeal

These invalidate the product intent.

---

## Versioning Notes

All changes prior to freeze must be:
- logged
- intentional
- justified against functional requirements

Once frozen, changes require a formal re-open.

## Internal Reminder
