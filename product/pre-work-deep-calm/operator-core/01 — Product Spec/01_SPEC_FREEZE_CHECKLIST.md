# Spec Freeze Checklist — Threshold: Pre-Work Deep Calm

This checklist defines the **exact conditions** required before the
product specification may be marked **FROZEN**.

All items must be satisfied simultaneously.

---

## 1. Sensory Consistency (Repeatability)

☐ Two full tastings completed on different days  
☐ Same formulation used  
☐ Same evaluation system used  

Observations align across:
☐ Bitterness quality  
☐ Astringency  
☐ Mouthfeel  
☐ Finish  
☐ Aftertaste / grounding effect  

No new issues emerged in the second tasting.

---

## 2. Functional Appropriateness

Without hedging, the following statement is true:

☐ “This chocolate is appropriate for repeated, deliberate, pre-work use.”

Specifically:
☐ No harsh or irritating finish  
☐ No heaviness or cloying sensation  
☐ No stimulating or jittery effect  
☐ No resistance to using it again  

---

## 3. No Open Technical Fixes

☐ No unresolved issues remain that would materially improve function  
☐ No expectation that further tweaking is required  
☐ Any remaining imperfections are cosmetic or preference-based  

If you are thinking “we should probably adjust X” → do not freeze.

---

## 4. Manufacturer Reproducibility

☐ Manufacturer confirms formulation is reproducible  
☐ Can be produced at intended pilot scale  
☐ No special one-off handling required  
☐ Texture and tempering are stable  

If the product is good but fragile → do not freeze.

---

## 5. Downstream Compatibility

Freezing the spec does not block next steps:

☐ Piece size can be standardised  
☐ Packaging constraints are compatible  
☐ Unit economics still function at pilot scale  
☐ No sourcing or regulatory red flags  

---

## Freeze Declaration (Required)

Once all boxes above are checked:

1. Open `01_PRODUCT_SPEC.md`
2. Update **SPEC STATUS** to: Status: 

FROZEN
Date:
Formulation version:
Freeze rationale:

3. Write a short rationale explaining why this version was accepted
4. Save the file

That timestamp is the **official freeze moment**.

---

## Important Notes

- Taste preference alone never blocks or reopens freeze
- External opinions do not override this checklist
- Pilot feedback only reopens the spec if core function fails

---

## Internal Reminder

Freezing the spec does not mean perfection.

It means:
> “This is the version we are willing to test honestly.”
