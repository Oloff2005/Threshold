Formal Practice Definition

Product: Pre-Work Deep Calm

Purpose of this step:
To lock when, how, and why the product is used so that all future decisions (formulation, packaging, branding, dosing) are constrained by a clear behavioral practice.

If the practice is unclear, everything downstream becomes noise.

What a Threshold Practice Is

A Threshold practice is:
	•	deliberate
	•	repeatable
	•	calm and secular
	•	low-friction but not automatic
	•	designed to initiate a state transition, not deliver an effect

The practice is considered part of the product.
Using the chocolate without the practice is misuse, not a success case.

Practice Definition — Pre-Work Deep Calm

This is the canonical practice. You are not brainstorming here — you are defining.

⸻

1. When It Is Taken

Timing window:
	•	Immediately before the start of a focused work block
	•	After all preparatory actions are complete (water, bathroom, setup)
	•	Before opening any cognitively demanding task

Explicit exclusions:
	•	Not during work
	•	Not as a snack
	•	Not as background consumption
	•	Not more than once per defined work block

This creates a single clear threshold moment.

⸻

2. Physical Context

The practice is performed:
	•	seated or standing still
	•	without screens in hand
	•	without other food or drink being consumed simultaneously

The environment should already be quiet enough to begin.

The chocolate does not create calm from chaos — it marks entry into calm.

⸻

3. Sequence of Actions (Non-Negotiable Order)
	1.	Pause
Stop all movement. No multitasking.
	2.	Open
Unwrap the chocolate fully. Do not rush this step.
	3.	Consume
Place the piece in the mouth and allow it to melt.
Do not chew aggressively.
	4.	Breathe
One slow breath in, one slow breath out, while the chocolate melts.
	5.	Begin
Start the first task of the work block immediately after.

This entire sequence should take under one minute, but must never feel rushed.

⸻

4. Intended State Transition

Before:
	•	mentally scattered
	•	externally distracted
	•	undecided about where to begin

After:
	•	calm
	•	oriented
	•	committed to a single task

The goal is clarity and readiness, not stimulation or motivation.

If the user feels “energized,” that is incidental — not the objective.

⸻

5. Frequency and Boundaries
	•	One practice per work block
	•	Maximum: 2 practices per day
	•	Not intended for casual repetition

Overuse is a failure of discipline, not a design goal.

⸻

6. What This Practice Is NOT

The Pre-Work Deep Calm practice is not:
	•	a productivity hack
	•	a stimulant replacement
	•	a mood enhancer
	•	a reward
	•	a treat

It is a delimiter between intention and execution.

⸻

Why This Must Be Frozen

This practice definition:
	•	constrains formulation (no spikes, no urgency)
	•	constrains taste (restraint > pleasure)
	•	constrains packaging (quiet, minimal, deliberate)
	•	constrains branding (no hype, no speed)

Changing the practice later would invalidate downstream decisions.

Therefore:

This practice definition is a frozen decision unless revised through the Operator Core with explicit justification.
