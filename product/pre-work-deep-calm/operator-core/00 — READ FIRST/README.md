# Operating Core — Source of Truth

This folder is the **authoritative source of truth** for the Threshold product
“Pre-Work Deep Calm”.

All critical decisions about the product, its function, its constraints, and
its readiness to progress to the next stage are made **here and only here**.

If there is ever a conflict between files, folders, opinions, or versions,
**Operating Core wins**.

## What Belongs in Operating Core

Operating Core contains:

- Product specifications (what the product *is*)
- Non-negotiables and constraints (what the product *cannot become*)
- Tasting and evaluation systems
- Supplier feedback and technical decisions
- Pilot design, criteria, and success thresholds
- Go / No-Go logic
- Operator principles and phase definitions

Everything here should be:
- deliberate
- defensible
- decision-oriented

---

## What Does NOT Belong in Operating Core

The following are explicitly **not allowed** in this folder:

- Visual design assets
- Branding language or storytelling
- Marketing copy or positioning experiments
- Raw opinions or unstructured feedback
- “Ideas” that are not tied to a decision
- Drafts that have not been consciously accepted

Those belong in other folders or in the Archive.

---

## Authority Rules

- No external feedback (friends, family, experts, advisors) can override
  decisions made here unless explicitly re-opened.
- Pilot results inform decisions but do not automatically change them.
- Design and branding must conform to constraints defined here.
- Growth, UGC, and marketing are downstream of decisions made here.

Operating Core defines **reality**. Other folders express, test, or scale it.

---

## Change Control

Decisions in Operating Core are **not continuously fluid**.

Before changing anything here, ask:

1. Has new evidence been generated through a controlled process?
2. Is this change aligned with the current phase objective?
3. Am I changing this to reduce friction — or to reduce discomfort?

If the answer to (3) is “reduce discomfort”, do not change it.

---

## Current Phase

**Phase:** Product Lock-In (Pre-Pilot)

Primary objective:
> Lock a chocolate product that is appropriate for repeated,
> deliberate, pre-work use — independent of taste preference.

Secondary objectives are explicitly deprioritised.

## Internal Reminder

You are not building a product to be liked.

You are building a **tool** that earns trust through
clarity, restraint, and repeatable function.

This folder exists to protect that standard.
