# Operator Authority & Decision Freeze

## Authority — Where Decisions Live

Authoritative decisions for Pre-Work Deep Calm live only in:
- `/product/pre-work-deep-calm/operator-core/00 — READ FIRST`
- `/product/pre-work-deep-calm/operator-core/01 — Product Spec`
- `/product/pre-work-deep-calm/operator-core/02 — Tasting System`
- `/product/pre-work-deep-calm/operator-core/03 — Supplier & Manufacturing`
- `/product/pre-work-deep-calm/operator-core/05 — Pilot System`
- `/product/pre-work-deep-calm/operator-core/06 — Ops & Logistics`

If a decision is not recorded in one of these locations, it is not considered active or binding.

Final decision authority rests with the product operator; documentation exists to preserve clarity, not to outsource judgment.

## Decisions That Must Be Frozen Deliberately

A frozen decision is one that should not change without explicit review and documentation, even if it feels inconvenient or suboptimal in the short term.

Freeze the following categories with explicit intent:
- Product purpose and use-case boundaries
- Core formulation constraints and ingredient exclusions
- Dosage, serving format, and consumption protocol
- Safety, compliance, and manufacturing requirements
- Pilot success criteria and go/no-go thresholds
- Non-negotiable packaging or handling constraints

## Revising a Frozen Decision

A frozen decision can be revised only if:
- new evidence exists (pilot data, supplier constraints, or safety findings), and
- the change is recorded in the authoritative location with a dated rationale, and
- the revision states what is replaced and why.

No back-channel overrides. No silent edits.

## Changes Allowed Without Escalation

The following changes are permitted without re-opening a frozen decision:
- Clarifying language without changing meaning
- Formatting, organization, or file location within Operator Core
- Adding evidence or test results that do not alter the decision
- Adding implementation notes downstream of a frozen decision
