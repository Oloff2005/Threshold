# Pre-Work Deep Calm — Project Overview

This folder contains all work related to the Threshold product
**“Pre-Work Deep Calm”**.

It is structured to separate **truth, expression, validation, and growth**
so that decisions are made deliberately and not re-litigated.

---

## Folder Roles (Read This Before Working)

### 🔒 Operating Core — AUTHORITY
Source of truth for:
- product specification
- constraints and non-negotiables
- tasting systems
- pilot criteria and go / no-go decisions

If there is ever a conflict between folders,
**Operating Core wins**.

---

### 🎨 Design & Branding — EXPRESSION
Contains:
- packaging designs
- logos
- typography
- visual systems

Design expresses decisions made elsewhere.
No product decisions are made here.

---

### 🧪 Pilot — VALIDATION
Contains:
- pilot instructions
- contact scripts
- surveys and metrics
- pilot results

The pilot tests product truth under controlled conditions.
It does not redefine the product automatically.

---

### 📣 UGC — GROWTH (FUTURE)
Contains:
- user-generated content systems
- creator briefs
- growth assets

This folder remains inactive until:
- product spec is frozen
- pilot outcome = GO

UGC expresses truth; it does not discover it.

---

### 🗄 Archive — MEMORY
Contains:
- deprecated designs
- old iterations
- superseded documents

Nothing active lives in Archive.

## Operating Rule

If you are unsure where something belongs,
or what should be worked on next,
open **Operating Core first**.

This structure exists to reduce confusion,
prevent drift, and protect product integrity.
