Threshold

Threshold is an intentional product system built around one core idea:

The most important moments are transitions.

Rather than forcing productivity or rest, Threshold designs calm, deliberate tools that help people cross the threshold between mental states — from distraction into focus, and from work into rest.

This repository is the operating system for Threshold.

It is not a marketing repository.
It is a system for clear thinking, disciplined execution, and long-term coherence.

What Threshold Is

Threshold is not a single product.

It is a product family designed around entry and exit rituals for cognitively demanding work.

The system is built to support:
	•	starting work deliberately
	•	ending work deliberately
	•	reducing friction at transitions
	•	building habits without relying on motivation

Each product exists as a tool, not a stimulant or indulgence.

⸻

Current Products

Threshold currently consists of two products:

Pre-Work Deep Calm

A ritual chocolate designed to support the transition into focused work.
	•	Used at the beginning of a work session
	•	Emphasises calm, clarity, and intentional start
	•	Actively developed and validated

Post-Work Deep Rest

A ritual chocolate designed to support the transition out of work.
	•	Used at the end of a workday or focus block
	•	Emphasises closure, disengagement, and recovery
	•	Currently scaffolded (conceptual, not active)

These products are counterparts, not variants.

⸻

Core Philosophy

Threshold is built on non-negotiable principles:
	•	Gentle nudges over force
	•	Ritual over consumption
	•	Systems over motivation
	•	Clarity before scale
	•	Minimalism over excess

These principles apply equally to:
	•	product design
	•	formulation decisions
	•	packaging
	•	operations
	•	and this repository itself

Repository Structure (System-Level)

/product
/brand
/ugc
/ops
/archive

README.md
.gitignore

Each top-level folder represents a system, not a phase or task list.

⸻

/product — Product Operating Systems

/product
  /pre-work-deep-calm
  /post-work-deep-rest

Each product lives in its own folder and contains:
	•	a product-level README
	•	a full Operator Core
	•	explicitly named files tied to that product

The Operator Core is the product’s brain.
It defines how decisions are made, tested, frozen, and evolved.

Products are developed in parallel, never tangled together.

⸻

/brand — Brand & Design Systems

/brand
  /pre-work-deep-calm
  /post-work-deep-rest (to be added when active)

This folder contains:
	•	visual identity
	•	packaging design
	•	typography
	•	brand positioning
	•	archived design iterations

Brand is treated as a system, not decoration.

⸻

/ugc — Distribution & Media Systems

/ugc
  /pre-work-deep-calm

This folder contains:
	•	creator briefs
	•	admin and agreements
	•	incoming / approved content
	•	live assets (ads, social, website)

UGC is treated as infrastructure, not random content creation.

⸻

/ops — Cross-Product Operations (Reserved)

/ops

This folder is intentionally minimal.

It exists to eventually hold:
	•	cross-product logistics
	•	finance and unit economics
	•	tooling and internal systems
	•	manufacturing standards

Nothing is placed here prematurely.

⸻

/archive — Frozen History

/archive
  /pre-work-deep-calm

The archive contains:
	•	early plans
	•	historical documents
	•	past specs
	•	exploratory thinking
	•	superseded decisions

Archive is preserved, not deleted.

It exists to maintain context and prevent repeating mistakes.

How to Navigate This Repository
	•	To understand Threshold as a system:
Read this README.
	•	To understand a specific product:
/product → product-name → README.md
	•	To make or evaluate decisions:
/product → product-name → operator-core
	•	To work on brand or packaging:
/brand → product-name
	•	To work on content or distribution:
/ugc → product-name
	•	To review past thinking:
/archive → product-name

If something feels rushed, unclear, or emotionally driven — return to the Operator Core.

⸻

Commit Discipline

Commits are expected to represent:
	•	meaningful system changes
	•	structural decisions
	•	spec updates
	•	clearly scoped refactors

Noise, temporary files, and OS artifacts are intentionally excluded.

This repository is designed to remain calm to reason about.

⸻

Status
	•	Active product: Pre-Work Deep Calm
	•	Scaffolded product: Post-Work Deep Rest
	•	Phase: early validation, clarity-first development

Threshold is being built slowly on purpose.

⸻

Final Note

This repository is a long-term system, not a sprint artifact.

Speed without clarity is treated as risk.
Structure is preferred over urgency.

If you are reading this as a collaborator — or as future-you:

Assume every file exists for a reason, even if that reason is historical.
